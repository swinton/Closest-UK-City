Computing the distance between two locations on Earth from coordinates

The following code returns the distance between to locations based on each point's longitude and latitude. The distance returned is relative to Earth's radius. To get the distance in miles, multiply by 3960. To get the distance in kilometers, multiply by 6373.

Latitude is measured in degrees north of the equator; southern locations have negative latitude. Similarly, longitude is measured in degrees east of the Prime Meridian. A location 10° west of the Prime Meridian, for example, could be expressed as either 350° east or as -10° east.
